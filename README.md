# Freight-Operations-Managment-system-FOMS-
**Short description**
 This project involves designing and implementiong a web-based freight operations managment system that models core logistics workflows. The system will simulate shipment creation, driver assignment, real-time status updates, and delivery documentation using internally generated data. 


## Overview
The Freight Operations Management System (FOMS) is a web-based software project that simulates core logistics and freight workflows. The system models how shipments are created, assigned, tracked, and completed within a centralized platform. This project is developed as a minimum viable product (MVP) for a senior capstone course, with a focus on software design rather than real-world carrier integration.

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate end-to-end workflow management in a logistics-style system
- Explore real-time and event-driven system behavior
- Implement role-based user interactions
- Apply software engineering principles learned throughout the program

## MVP Scope
The MVP will support the following features using simulated data:
- Shipment creation and viewing
- Assignment of shipments to drivers
- Real-time shipment status updates
- Role-based access for different user types
- Automatic generation of delivery confirmation data

## User Roles
- **Shipper**: Creates and views shipments
- **Driver**: Updates shipment status during transit
- **Administrator**: Manages shipments and driver assignments

## Technology (Planned)
- Web-based client–server architecture
- Backend API for business logic and state management
- Frontend interface for user interaction
- Simulated data in place of external logistics APIs

Specific technologies and frameworks will be finalized during the design phase.

## Project Status
This project is currently in the **planning and requirements specification phase**.  
Implementation will proceed incrementally throughout the semester.

## Documentation
Additional documentation can be found in the `docs/` directory:
- `requirements.md` – Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- `architecture.md` – System architecture and design notes

## Disclaimer
This project uses **simulated data only** and is intended for educational purposes. It does not integrate with real freight carriers or logistics providers.
